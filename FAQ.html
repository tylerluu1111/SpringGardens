        <h3>When will my order ship?</h3>
        <p>We strive to ship our orders at the beginning of the week to ensure they are delivered prior to the weekend. All orders are shipped within 1-3 days after the order is processed, unless you have requested otherwise.</p>
        <h3>What forms of payment do you accept?</h3>
        <p>We accept PayPal, Visa, Master Card, American Express, Discover, Amazon Pay, Facebook Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, Affirm, & Venmo.</p>
        <h3>Do you offer discounts on wholesale items?</h3>
        <p>We do!  You are welcome to visit our Wholesale page to request more information.  We will gladly put together a quote to offer you the best price we can on your order!</p>
        <h3>Can I return my plants?</h3>
        <p>From time to time customers will want to return their plants even though we offer an abundance of information to each customer when ordering their plants. Since plants and trees are perishable items, they cannot be returned without our permission. Restocking fees will be charged to each customer who returns a plant in live condition with authorization from Perfect Plants. Restocking fees will be 25% of the purchase price of the original order. If your order is accepted for returns, we will offer a store credit for the purchase price, less the 25% re-stocking fee. Non-perishable items, such as fertilizers, tree water bags, pruning shears, planting mixes, etc may be subject for returns with Perfect Plants Nursery permission. Customer will be responsible for all shipping and processing charges. We do not refund shipping cost to customers to return their plants to us.</p>
